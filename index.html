<h1 id="toc_0">Basic Agile Execution Template</h1>

<p>I propose a starting point for teams to begin their Agile journey, I believe this is a good place to
start from but absolutely not a good end-goal. Teams should use this template and iterate on it
until they have their own agile process that enables them to execute with peak throughput.</p>

<div class="wideimg-container">
<img class="wideimg" src="/assets/media/basic_agile_template.png">
</div>

<p>The primary design principle for this template is to maximize the amount of value a team can deliver
during a "cycle" (e.g. a sprint), in other words, it maximizes for throughput, with the
understanding that once a team starts applying it they'll find improvement opportunities for their
particular domain.</p>

<p>The most important thing to remember while using this approach is that every decision and action
that the team does should maximize throughput (amount value delivered over time).</p>

<p>By value I mean <em>working software that helps stakeholders achieve a goal</em>. If the software is not
<strong>already</strong> helping the stakeholder(s) achieve their goal, then the team has NOT delivered value.
The degree by which the software helps the stakeholder(s) achieve their goal(s) and how important
that goal(s) determines how valuable the software is.</p>

<p>Dear Hardship,</p>

<p>Do you remember when you made it hard to walk? You taught me that not all pain comes from
voluntary actions, yet I can find the strength in me to walk while in the company of pain.</p>

<p>Do you remember when you wouldn't let me sleep? So I could learn that the floor can be just
as good a place to sleep as any bed, that pain can be pacified with meditation.</p>

<p>You're an eager teacher, looking for worthy students without discrimination, you embrace
whomever finds you or stumbles unto you. In your eyes we're all equal and I love you for it.</p>

<p>Whenever I come knocking at your door, you open it for me, always ready to teach me a lesson,
to remind me of my limits and how to surpass them, to remind me that everything I need to
surpass my limits is within me.</p>

<p>You make every success that much sweeter, for nothing great is ever achieved without you,
and knowing that only very few embrace you as part of themselves makes success all that much more
unique.</p>

<p>If it weren't for you, I would not be able to climb high, for you are the mountain upon which I
climb. If it weren't for you, I would not be able to learn, for you are the lesson from which I
learn.</p>

  <div class="summary ellipsis">
<h1 id="toc_0">Software Goodness</h1>

<p>The <em>Ultimate Purpose of Software</em> is to <em>help somebody achieve a greater goal</em>
<a id="ref1" href="#fn1" class="fn-link">1</a>. The degree of <em>Software
Goodness</em> of a piece of software is <em>the degree to which the software realizes
its ultimate purpose</em>.</p>

<p>For example, software that helps 1M people learn algebra can be said to have
greater Software Goodness <a id="ref2" href="#fn2" class="fn-link">2</a> than
another software that helps only 100 people learn algebra.</p>

<p>Note that people who benefit from software can be anyone impacted by the
software, other software engineers, for example. If a library is a joy to use
(due to its -ilities [readability, simplicity, robustness, etc]), then it can be
said that it achieves greater Software Goodness than a library that is a pain to
use (due to its lack of -ilities).</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">What drives a person to pursue Software Goodness?</h2>

<p>I believe that what drives a peson to write software with a high degree of
Goodness is that person's Care <a id="ref3" href="#fn3" class="fn-link">3</a>
<a id="ref4" href="#fn4" class="fn-link">4</a> for others and the greater goal
the software is helping achieve.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">What is a Human?</h3>

<p>We define a human by that which a human essentially is. Humans (like everything else in existence)
are interactions of the universe happening <em>here</em> and <em>now</em>.</p>

<p>For example, a wave is an interaction of the ocean <em>and</em> it <em>is</em> the ocean, the ocean is an
interaction of planet earth and also the earth, the earth is an interaction of the solar system and
also the solar system, and so on, until we reach the Universe.</p>

<p>In the same fashion, a nail is an interaction of your body and it is also your body, your nail is
you, because you are defined by <em>all</em> of you (nails included).</p>

<p>We can say that humans (just like everything else in this planet) are an interaction of the planet
<em>and</em> we are also the planet, the solar system, the milky way galaxy, the constellation and the
Universe.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we say that a Human is, essentially, an interaction of the Universe and is also the
Universe itself expressing in the form of a Human.</p>
